Html file is loaded.
It converted to raw bytes - 
charset can be configured - tokenisation (h1, p, html, body)
relations
nodes -> nodelist.
DOM


Similarly for CSS
    raw - character set - token - objects - relations - model.
    CSS OM. 

once we have the html dom and the css om it starts to construct the tree.
the browser engine takes care of how much area is available for it to paint.

once the script tag is found the dom loading is temporarily stopped.

(once the css dom is found the js loading is also stopped ? weird.)

but many of the async loading takes care of that.


javascript is a dynamically typed language
